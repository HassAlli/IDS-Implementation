# IDS Implementation Code

This is Implementation code of the **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)** algorithm, which is a combination of Depth-First Search *(DFS)* and Breadth-First Search *(BFS)*. IDS is used to search for a target node or state in a tree or graph while minimizing memory usage. It explores nodes at increasing depths until it finds the target.
